# HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

<ul>
<li>I wanted to create a website where code follows accesibilty standards so that the website is optimized for search engines. </li>
<li>I wanted to properly deploy a website through Github by creating branches and pushing new modificatitons of the code to the Github without destroying the mockup of the original website.
<li>The semantics of the original starter-code was not proper so proper semantics were in place to the appropiate sections in the HTML code.</li>
<li>The CSS file had repetitive code of the same thing, so the CSS selectors was condensed without changing the original mockup of the website.
<li>The images did not have alternative text for them, so alternative was added because in case a client cannot properly load up the images on their browser.
<li>A proper README was created along with the website.
</ul>
